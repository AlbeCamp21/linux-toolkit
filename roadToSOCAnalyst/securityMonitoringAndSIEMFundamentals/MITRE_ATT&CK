# MITRE ATT&CK & Security Operations

## 1. What is MITRE ATT&CK?
**MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally accessible, living knowledge base of adversary behavior based on real-world observations.

* **Tactics:** The attacker's immediate strategic goals (The "Why").
* **Techniques:** The specific methods used to achieve those goals (The "How").
* **Procedures:** The step-by-step implementation of a technique (The "What").

> **Matrices:** The framework offers specific matrices for different environments, including **Enterprise**, **Mobile**, and **Cloud**.

## 2. Key Use Cases in Security Operations

### A. Detection and Response
* Enables SOCs to create detection rules (SIEM/EDR) mapped to known attacker behaviors.
* Provides a proactive blueprint for developing countermeasures.

### B. Gap Analysis and SOC Maturity
* **Gap Analysis:** Identifies which parts of the network lack defensive coverage.
* **Maturity Assessment:** Measures a SOC's ability to detect and respond to specific TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

### C. Threat Intelligence & Enrichment
* Provides a **Unified Language** for internal teams and external stakeholders to share information about threats.
* Enriches Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with context on potential targets and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

### D. Behavioral Analytics
* Helps develop models to identify anomalous activities by mapping system behaviors to the ATT&CK framework.

### E. Offensive Security (Red Teaming)
* Provides a systematic way to replicate real-world attacker techniques during penetration tests to evaluate defensive strengths.

## 3. Summary of Benefits
* **Standardized Communication:** Creates a common framework for both Red Teams (Offensive) and Blue Teams (Defensive).
* **Proactive Defense:** Moves the focus from simple IOCs (like IP addresses) to understanding attacker behaviors.
* **Resource Prioritization:** Helps organizations invest in security controls that address the most relevant threats.
