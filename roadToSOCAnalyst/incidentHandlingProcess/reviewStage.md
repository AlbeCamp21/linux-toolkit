# Incident Handling Process: Review Stage

## 1. Overview of Post-Incident Activity

The Review Stage is the final phase of the incident handling process. Its primary goal is to document the entire event and identify opportunities to improve the organization's security posture. This stage transforms a crisis into a learning experience, ensuring that the same attack vector cannot be successfully exploited in the future.

## 2. The Post-Incident Review Process

Once the incident is resolved, the team must move through a structured workflow to close the case effectively.

### Key Workflow Steps
* **Post-Incident Review:** A comprehensive gathering of all logs, evidence, and the finalized timeline to understand the technical details of the breach.
* **Lessons Learned Meeting:** A collaborative session with all stakeholders to discuss what worked, what failed, and how the team responded under pressure.
* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** A deep dive into the underlying vulnerability that allowed the incident to happen (e.g., a missing patch, a weak password, or a lack of multi-factor authentication).
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Distributing the findings to other technical teams and using the incident as a real-world example for user awareness training.

## 3. Comprehensive Incident Reporting

The final report is the most important document of this stage. it serves as a historical record, a training tool, and potentially as evidence in legal proceedings.

### Critical Questions the Report Must Answer
* **Scope and Impact:** Exactly what happened, when did it start, and what was the total cost or data loss?
* **Team Performance:** Did the current plans, playbooks, and policies provide enough guidance during the incident?
* **Remediation Actions:** What specific steps were taken to contain and eradicate the threat?
* **Future Prevention:** What technical controls or resources (tools, budget, personnel) are needed to prevent a recurrence?

## 4. Continuous Improvement of Capabilities

This stage is not just about documentation; it is about evolving the defense strategy based on real-world data.

### Updating Defensive Assets
* **Playbook Refinement:** Improving the "step-by-step" guides used by analysts to ensure faster response times in future events.
* **Detection Tuning:** Creating new SIEM rules or EDR signatures based on the behavior observed during the attack to detect similar threats earlier.
* **Policy Updates:** Adjusting corporate policies to address security gaps identified during the Root Cause Analysis.

## 5. Metrics and Accountability

By documenting every incident, the security team can provide management with measurable results:
* **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** How long the attacker was in the network before being caught.
* **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** How long it took the team to neutralize the threat.
* **Trend Analysis:** Identifying if certain types of attacks (like phishing) are becoming more frequent, justifying more investment in specific security areas.
